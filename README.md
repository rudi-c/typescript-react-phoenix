# Typescript + React + Phoenix

This is a very simple template project showing how to using Typescript and React along with Phoenix, using Webpack as the build tool. This repository is meant to accompany the tutorial I have written on the subject, found at [http://digitalfreepen.com/2017/07/14/how-to-typescript-react-phoenix.html](http://digitalfreepen.com/2017/07/14/how-to-typescript-react-phoenix.html).
